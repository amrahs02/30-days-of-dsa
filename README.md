# 30 Days of DSA

![DSA](https://amrahs02.github.io/portfolio_modified/images/dsa.png)

Welcome to the **30 Days of DSA** repository! This repository documents my 30-day journey of learning and practicing Data Structures and Algorithms. The purpose of this challenge is to enhance my problem-solving skills and deepen my understanding of core programming concepts.

## Overview

Each day's progress is organized into individual folders labeled as `Day_X`, where X represents the day number of the challenge. In these folders, you will find my code implementations, explanations, and reflections on the various data structures and algorithms I've worked on.

## Table of Contents

- [Day 1](./Day_1): Brief overview of what I accomplished on Day 1.
- [Day 2](./Day_2): Brief overview of what I accomplished on Day 2.
- ...
- [Day 30](./Day_30): Summary of my achievements and thoughts on the final day.

## About Me

I'm an enthusiastic programmer committed to expanding my skills Data Structure and Algorithms. This 30-day challenge is an integral part of my continuous growth as a developer.

## Goals

- Learn fundamental data structures including arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and hash tables.
- Explore essential algorithms such as searching, sorting, recursion, dynamic programming, and more.
- Solve coding problems from platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and Codeforces.
- Develop proficiency in problem analysis, algorithm design, and writing clean, optimized code.

## Progress Tracking

I'll be updating this repository daily with my code solutions, concept explanations, and any challenges I face during the challenge. Feel free to explore, provide feedback, and learn alongside me!
